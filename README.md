  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  Answer: The work on the project has helped me keep my work more organized. After doing this project and having everything right where it needed to be in the code, it made it much more legible and easy to follow.
  
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  Answer: My design process started by identifying what the requirements were, then I would find the best way to implement what was required. I would test almost every change that was made until it fit what was required.
  
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  Answer: These tactics from my design approach are very basic aand should be implemented in all future work. Studying the requirements of a project is one of the most important aspects of the design process.
  
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  Answer: A strategy that I used while working on my 3D scene was using modular and reusable code. While this isnt the first time ive used these, this is one of the most its been used in a project for me, helping me become more familiar with it.
  
  How did iteration factor into your development?
  Answer: Iteration played a very big part in my development, especially when it came to creating the 3D objects. Features such as lighting and camera movement had to be iterated on multiple times to get it just right, and with the objects, those needed to be iterated on dozens of times to make sure everything fit right.
  
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  Answer: Throughout the milestones my approach didnt change a whole lot, maybe after the first one I got the hang of it better, after going through all of the resources and actively looking through the code, seeing what can be altered or added to help me achieve what I need.
  
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Answer: Computational graphics and visualizations have helped me gain a better understanding of some complex mathmatical concepts, which will help me greatly in the field of computer science.
  
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  Answer: Depending on what career path I go down, computational graphics and visualizations could play a massive part in my professional pathway. But even if I dont go down a game dev career path or something similar, the critical thinking skills gained by the course will transfer to whichever career path I may take.
